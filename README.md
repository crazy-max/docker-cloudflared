$ docker run --rm mplatform/mquery crazymax/cloudflared:latest
Image: crazymax/cloudflared:latest
 * Manifest List: Yes
 * Supported platforms:
   - linux/amd64
   - linux/arm/v6
   - linux/arm/v7

## Environment variables

* `TZ`: The timezone assigned to the container (default `UTC`)
* `TUNNEL_DNS_UPSTREAM`: Upstream endpoint URL, you can specify multiple endpoints for redundancy. (default `https://1.1.1.1/dns-query,https://1.0.0.1/dns-query`)
* `TUNNEL_DNS_PORT`: DNS listening port (default `5053`)
* `TUNNEL_DNS_ADDRESS`: DNS listening IP (default `0.0.0.0` "all interfaces")

## Ports

* `5053/udp`: Listen port for the DNS over HTTPS proxy server
* `49312/tcp`: Listen port for metrics reporting

## Usage

### Docker Compose

Docker compose is the recommended way to run this image. You can use the following [docker compose template](examples/compose/docker-compose.yml), then run the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Command line

You can also use the following minimal command :

```bash
docker run -d --name cloudflared \
  -p 5053:5053/udp \
  -p 49312:49312 \
  crazymax/cloudflared:latest
```

## Notes

### Performance issues

For a DNS server with lots of short-lived connections, you may wish to consider adding `--net=host` to the run command
or `network_mode: "host"` in your compose file for performance reasons (see [#22](https://github.com/crazy-max/docker-cloudflared/issues/22)).
However, it is not required and some shared container hosting services may not allow it. You should also be aware
`--net=host` can be a security risk in some situations. The [Center for Internet Security - Docker 1.6 Benchmark](https://github.com/cismirror/old-benchmarks-archive/blob/master/CIS_Docker_1.6_Benchmark_v1.0.0.pdf)
recommends against this mode since it essentially tells Docker to not containerize the container's networking, thereby
giving it full access to the host machine's network interfaces. It also mentions this option could cause the container
to do unexpected things such as shutting down the Docker host as referenced in [moby/moby#6401](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/6401).
For the most secure deployment, unrelated services with confidential data should not be run on the same host or VPS.
In such cases, using `--net=host` should have limited impact on security.

### Use with Pi-hole

[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) currently [provides documentation](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns-over-https/) to manually set up DNS-Over-HTTPS with Cloudflared.

With Docker and this image, it's quite easy to use it with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/). Take a look at this simple [docker compose template](examples/pihole/docker-compose.yml) and you're ready to go.

## Upgrade

To upgrade, pull the newer image and launch the container :

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```
